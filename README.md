Featured Projects

Here is a summary of the projects I have completed:

1. [Project 3] Customer Churn Prediction Web App (End-to-End)

Project Folder: Telco_Churn_Predictor/

Objective: To build an interactive web application to predict customer churn using a classic machine learning model.

Skills Demonstrated:

Traditional ML: Trained a Random Forest Classifier model using Scikit-learn with 98.5% accuracy.

Deployment: Used Streamlit to deploy the model (.joblib) as a functional and interactive UI.

Full Lifecycle: Demonstrated the entire workflow: from raw data -> training -> model saving -> web application.

2. [Project 2] Text Sentiment Analysis (Advanced NLP)

Project Folder: NLP_Sentiment_Analysis/

Objective: To use Transfer Learning to fine-tune a Transformer (BERT) model for a text classification task.

Skills Demonstrated:

Transformer Architecture: Successfully implemented and trained a BERT model (bert-base-uncased).

NLP Pipeline: Handled tokenization, data loading (Hugging Face datasets), and fine-tuning on a movie review dataset.

Model Analysis: Identified overfitting (100% accuracy) on a small sample dataset (1,000) and understood the need for a larger dataset for generalization.

3. [Project 1] Image Classification (GPU-Accelerated CV)

Project Folder: Computer_Vision_Classifier/

Objective: To use Transfer Learning with ResNet18 to classify images, accelerated by an NVIDIA RTX 2050.

Skills Demonstrated:

GPU Acceleration: Successfully configured the PyTorch (torch-gpu) environment to use CUDA, which significantly accelerated training.

Computer Vision: Implemented a modern CV pipeline, including image transformation (resizing 32x32 -> 224x224) and normalization.

Results: Achieved 79.5% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset in just 3 epochs, proving the effectiveness of Transfer Learning.
