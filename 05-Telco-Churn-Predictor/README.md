Project 3: End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction

Goal: To build and deploy a machine learning model that predicts customer churn likelihood for a telecommunications company.

Status: Completed and Deployed.

Key Features Demonstrated

Data Prep & Feature Engineering: Cleaned, processed, and one-hot encoded mock customer data (e.g., Monthly Charges, Contract Type).

Model: Trained a Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Achieved a [INSERT ACCURACY HERE]% Accuracy and a [INSERT F1-SCORE HERE] F1-Score.

Deployment (AI Engineering Skill): The final model was saved using Joblib and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. Users can input customer parameters and receive an instant churn prediction, demonstrating full production readiness.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit, Joblib.
